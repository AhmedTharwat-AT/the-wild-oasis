# The wild oasis hotel

This is the final project from jonas schmedtmann  - Ultimate React Course .
i took this course as a challenge and wrote the code rquired to manipulate data first then followed jonas approach and changed the required code accor accordingly.
this project helped me to practice how to plan for a big project and the steps required for each one . i got to practice many new libraries and how to handle data between them , react design patterns and how they can be used to save alot of time , it was fun and challenging
